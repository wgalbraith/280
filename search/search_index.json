Unlike routine exercises, real     problems rarely come with a clear recipe. They may be vague, messy, or missing information.     The goal of learning problem solving techniques is not to memorize one \u201cright method,\u201d but to     build habits that help you make progress when the path is uncertain.   </p> 1) Understand the Problem <p>     Start by clarifying what is being asked. Restate the problem in your own words, identify the     goal, and list what you know. If something is unclear, write down questions that would make it     clearer. Many mistakes happen because people begin solving before they fully understand the     task.   </p> 2) Organize Information <p>     Create a simple structure for the information you have. This might include a labeled sketch,     a table, a list of key facts, or a map. Define important terms and decide what quantities or     features matter. If the problem involves change, note what changes and what stays the same.   </p> 3) Break It Into Smaller Parts <p>     Large problems become manageable when divided into smaller questions. Ask: \u201cWhat would I need     to know first?\u201d or \u201cCan I solve a simpler version of this?\u201d Solving a related, easier problem     often reveals a strategy for the original one.   </p> 4) Look for Patterns and Relationships <p>     Many solutions come from noticing how parts of a problem connect. Compare cases, test small     examples, and look for repeated structure. If the problem includes data, examine trends or     relationships. If it is spatial, consider how location and distance matter.   </p> 5) Choose a Strategy and Make a Plan <p>     Good problem solvers try approaches deliberately. Common strategies include drawing a diagram,     making a table, working backward from the goal, testing extreme cases, or using estimation to     check whether an answer is reasonable. Write down a short plan before doing detailed work.   </p> 6) Carry Out the Plan Carefully <p>     Execute your steps with attention to detail. Keep your work organized so you can see what you     did and why. If you get stuck, pause and reassess: Did you misunderstand the problem? Is there     a different representation that would help (a diagram instead of words, or a table instead of a     list)? Trying a second approach is normal, not a failure.   </p> 7) Check and Communicate the Result <p>     After you reach a result, test it. Does it make sense in the context of the problem? Can you     explain it clearly to someone else? Check units, compare to estimates, and consider whether     alternative answers are possible. A solution is stronger when it is supported by reasoning, not     just a final number or statement.   </p> <p>     In this course, you will practice these techniques across many types of problems. Over time,     the aim is to become comfortable with uncertainty, to develop flexible strategies, and to build     confidence in your ability to make progress\u2014even when there is no obvious starting point.   </p>"},{"location":"statistics-ces.html","title":"CES Case Study","text":""},{"location":"statistics-ces.html#calenviroscreen","title":"CalEnviroScreen","text":"<p>The CalEnviroScreen tool and data set provides examples of several of the concepts we are exploring in this course.</p> <p>Here are some example questions and a tool that can provide evidence.</p> <ul> <li>How asthmatic is california? <ul> <li>histogram/distribution</li> <li>mean/median/deviation</li> </ul></li> <li>How is my regions asthma compared to CA? <ul> <li>percentile</li> </ul></li> <li>If I choose an area at random in CA, what is the chance it has higher asthma than my area? <ul> <li>percentile</li> </ul></li> <li>Do any groups (age, ancestry) have worse asthma <ul> <li>compare population histograms/means</li> </ul></li> <li>Are there variables that correlate with asthma? <ul> <li>linear regression</li> </ul></li> </ul>"},{"location":"statistics-ces.html#associations","title":"Associations","text":"<p>Keep in mind that these associations do not on their own establish causality.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"test-math.html","title":"Math test","text":""},{"location":"test-math.html#math-test","title":"Math test","text":"<p>Inline: $C = \\pi d$</p> <p>$$ V = L \\cdot W \\cdot H $$</p>"},{"location":"uncertainty.html","title":"Uncertainty","text":""},{"location":"uncertainty.html#uncertainty-and-approximations","title":"Uncertainty and Approximations","text":""},{"location":"uncertainty.html#estimations","title":"Estimations","text":"<ul> <li>Most math problems you have seen have been carefully created for you to solve them exactly</li> <li>Most problems that need to be solved are not so tidy</li> <li>Physicist Enrico Fermi was famous for posing these types of questions</li> <li>Precise vs Approximate reasoning</li> </ul> <p>We don\u2019t always know quantities precisely.
