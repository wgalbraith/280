## Dimensions, units, quantities

- A quantity represents a physical measurement like mass, length or
    amount of energy
- We represent a quantity with a number and a unit
- The dimension of a quantity is different than the unit
- For example 1 inch is the same as 2.54 centimeters even though 1 and
    2.54 are not the same number

## Physical Quantities

- Our numbers are often helping us represent physical quantities
- Examples:
    - The length of a tree
    - The number of animals observed
    - The number of molecules of mercury in a fish
- A physical quantity is expressed as the product of a unit and a
  numerical factor.

## Dimensions

- These physical quantities often have a dimension
- Examples:
    - Length
    - Time
    - Mass

In our estimations, we may have quantities that are not in fundamental
units such as length or time.  For example, we may be counting a
population of animals, or the number of power plants needed.

<!-- physics have 7 primary dimensions, we may have others -->

## Units

- To quantify dimensions, we use units
- One dimension may have multiple units
- Length: inches, miles, kilometers, light-years
- Mass: grams, pounds, kilograms
- There are also systems of units like SI or English

<!-- what are some units and some unusual units -->
<!-- clicks, bytes, click velocity -->

## Measurement

- Each measurement we make is an estimation of the physical quantity

## Consequences

- NASA Mars Climate Orbiter destroyed because of newton vs pounds of
force [link](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-oct-01-mn-17288-story.html)
