<h1 id="computation-fundamentals">Computation Fundamentals</h1>
<p>In professional environments, you will use a computer to perform your
computations. You likely have lots of practice on calculators. There are
significant similarities between the calculator and the computer but
there are some important differences.</p>
<p>While we want to develop our intuition when we are estimating with
large numbers, performing accurate calculations is also important. You
will be able to calculate these numbers on a hand-held calculator, in
Excel, and using scientific computing platforms like Python.</p>
<p>Since our calculations are often used as evidence to support an
argument, they must be easy to read and have clear methods and
assumptions. Using a computer to preserve the details of the calculation
is often preferable to using a calculator.</p>
<p>We will start with concepts most familiar to you from your work with
calculators and we will build more concepts on that knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="computers-and-humans">Computers and Humans</h1>
<p>Computers can augment our abilities. We want to separate tasks
between humans and computers in ways that take advantage of the
strengths of each.</p>
<p>Be warned, this work can be very frustrating. To use computers
effectively, we have to think in unfamiliar ways. The tools are very
powerful but it can be difficult to find mistakes in your work.</p>

<h2 id="computing-platforms">Computing platforms</h2>
<ul>
<li>You are likely most familiar with a calculator</li>
<li>You enter a series of commands</li>
<li>When you press enter or equals, they are sent to a small computer
for evaluation</li>
<li>The results are printed for you</li>
<li>There are many computer programs that do similar things and allow
much more power and flexibility</li>
<li>Other platforms are Mathematica and spreadsheets</li>
</ul>
