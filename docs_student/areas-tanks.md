<h1 id="rain-water-collection">Rain Water Collection</h1>
<p>Water scarcity and security is an important topic. Rain water
collection barrels are a way to address water efficiency.</p>
<p>We can use quantitative methods to make sure that we are meeting the
goals of a water collection system.</p>
<p>Our building has a collection system on the roof. Here are a few
questions we could ask depending on our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many barrels would we need to capture all of the rain water over
a season?</li>
<li>How much rain we can capture in our existing barrels before they are
full and we can no longer collect rain?</li>
<li>How much extra watering we can provide from the rain collection
barrels to the areas in the garden that we want to irrigate.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="strategy">Strategy</h1>
<p>These and related problems are a good use of our models for volume
and the technique of writing an equation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Equate two shapes that hold the same amount of water</li>
<li>Decide which variable you are solving for in your equation</li>
<li>Choose a set of units likely to make the problem easier</li>
<li>Find and write down the dimensions you can measure or estimate
directly</li>
<li>Solve your equation
<ul>
<li>Use the rules of algebra</li>
<li>Use the rules of unit conversions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<!-- Notice that the answer we want to find is the "height" of a box that we know how to find the volume of.

To estimate the rainfall we can capture, we create models for the volumes of water for both the roof and the tanks.

Then find the amount of rain by setting these two volumes equal and solving for the thickness of the rectangular prism we are using to model the roof. -->
