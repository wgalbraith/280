<h1 id="areas-concepts">Area and Volume Concepts</h1>
<p>It is useful to think about what it means to multiply and divide
lengths, areas, and volumes.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions about lengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a length times a number?</li>
<li>What is a length times a length?</li>
<li>What is a length divided by a number?</li>
<li>What is a length divided by a length?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some questions about areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is an area times a number?</li>
<li>What is an area times a length?</li>
<li>What is an area divided by a number?</li>
<li>What is an area divided by an area?</li>
<li>What is an area divided by a length?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some questions about volumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a volume times a number?</li>
<li>What is a volume divided by a number?</li>
<li>What is a volume divided by a length?</li>
<li>What is a volume divided by an area?</li>
<li>What is a volume divided by a volume?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="unit-conversion">Unit Conversion</h1>
<p>We often need to convert between units of area and volume. When we do
this, we need to look out for some common mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>A length is a dimension</li>
<li>Area has dimensions of length squared</li>
<li>Volume has dimensions of length cubed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="units">Units</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any two lengths multiplied is a valid unit of area
<ul>
<li>meters squared</li>
<li>inch-feet</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Any three lengths multiplied is a valid unit of volume
<ul>
<li>meters cubed</li>
<li>inch-feet-meters</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An area times a length is also a valid unit of volume
<ul>
<li>acre-foot</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We have units of area that don’t use lengths
<ul>
<li>acre</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We also have units of volume that don’t use lengths
<ul>
<li>liter</li>
<li>gallon</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="intuition">Intuition</h1>
<ul>
<li>What is something about the volume of a milliliter?</li>
<li>What is something about a liter?</li>
<li>A cubic foot?</li>
<li>A cubic meter?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is useful to have a visualization of how linear conversions, area
conversions, and volume conversions are related. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube#/media/File:Rubiks_cube_solved.jpg">Rubik’s
Cube</a> is a good visualization.</p>
<p>If we imagine the three-by-three cube side as a yard, we can imagine
each block as a foot. Then we see that there are</p>
<ul>
<li>3 feet in a yard</li>
<li>9 (3 x 3) square feet in a square yard</li>
<li>27 (3 x 3 x 3) cubic feet in a cubic yard</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="roots">Roots</h1>
<p>Roots answer the question, what is the size of square or cube that I
can fit a given quantity in?</p>
<h2 id="square-roots">Square roots</h2>
<ul>
<li>If I have a certain area, how do I find the square that contains
that area?</li>

volume?</li>

<h1 id="gpa">GPA</h1>
<p>The calculation of a grade point average can be thought of as an area
problem.</p>
<p><img src="./figures_static/areas/gpa-area.png" /></p>
<p>The average is the height of a rectangle that is 10 units long, or
2.79.</p>
<!-- # Average Power

If we have a power that is changing over time, we can interpret the area
under the curve as an energy.  The average power is the height of a
rectangle with the equal width and area.

this relationship between formulas and areas is what i find interesting

## Average Power

If we have a power that is changing over time, we can interpret the area under the curve as an energy.  
The average power is the height of a rectangle with the equal width and area.

## Pythagorean theorem

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

- We usually interpret as a relation between the sides of a right
  triangle
- We can also interpret as a statement about the areas
- It uses an equality
