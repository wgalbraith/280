<h1 id="volume-and-depth">7 Volume and Depth</h1>
<p>You have a given volume of water (say 2 gallons) and want to know how
deep the water will be when you pour that water into a rectangular fish
tank. Assume you know the length, width, and height of the fish tank.
Brainstorm and write down a strategy about how you will solve this
problem. Hint: if no water is spilled, the two volumes are equal.</p>
<h1 id="find-depth-of-fluid-given-a-volume">8 Find depth of fluid given
a volume</h1>
<p>You are hosting a birthday party and want to know how deep the water
will be in a kiddie pool. The kiddie pool 30 centimeters high and 2
meters by 2 meters at the base. This kiddie pool is a rectangular box,
not a cylinder.</p>
<p>You only have 1 cubic meter of water to use for filling the pool. How
deep will the water be in centimeters?</p>
<h1 id="cylindrical-tank-volume">9 Cylindrical tank volume</h1>
<p>You have a water tank that is modeled as a cylinder with a radius of
1.5 meters and a height of 2 meters. How many cubic meters of water does
this tank hold? How many gallons of water?</p>
<h1 id="height-of-water-in-a-tank">10 Height of water in a tank</h1>
<p>You have a cylindrical tank that has a 1.5 meter radius and is 2
meters high. You need to store 10 cubic meters of water in the tank. How
deep will the water be?</p>
<h1 id="rain-water-storage-strategy">11 Rain Water Storage Strategy</h1>
<p>To conserve water and improve resilience, imagine you’d like to store
all the rainwater from your roof over the course of a year and you’d
like to estimate the size of tank you need.</p>
<ul>
<li>What quantities would you need to estimate and why?</li>
<li>How will you put these quantities together to make an estimate?</li>
<li>What tools from this section will you use?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rain-water-storage-estimate">12 Rain Water Storage Estimate</h1>
<p>Write up your estimates of the tank sizes needed that answer the
following questions. Assume we are collecting water from our roofs at
home.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many gallons total will you need to store a year of rain and how
did you estimate this?</li>
<li>If the tank is 3 meters in diameter, how tall will it need to
be?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tank-scaling">13 Tank Scaling</h1>
<p>We’d like to increase the amount of water we can store in our
cylindrical tanks.</p>
<p>13.1 If you buy a tank with twice the diameter (same height) how much
larger is the volume?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>twice as much volume</li>
<li>four times as much volume</li>
<li>no way to tell</li>
</ol>
<p>13.2 If you buy a tank that is twice as tall (same diameter) how much
larger is the volume?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>twice as much volume</li>
<li>four times as much volume</li>
<li>no way to tell</li>
</ol>
<p>13.3 If you buy a tank that has twice the circumference as the
current tank, how much larger is the volume?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>twice as much volume</li>
<li>four times as much volume</li>
<li>no way to tell</li>
</ol>
