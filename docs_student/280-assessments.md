<h2 id="assessment-assignment-tips">Assessment Assignment Tips</h2>
<p>Here is a suggested workflow to create your video assignments for
these. Let me know if you find apps or ideas that could help others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a photo or scan of your assignment, ensure it is legible.</li>
<li>Use Zoom (or other screencasting software) to create a video focused
on the window with the scan.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ssu-estimation">1 SSU Estimation</h1>
<p>Come up with an estimate that involves all the students at SSU and
describe a simple model to calculate it. Show how you computed your
estimate and provide your estimate. You will upload a video narration
for this assignment.</p>
<h1 id="moon-shoulders">2 Moon Shoulders</h1>
<p>We’d like to go to the moon, but budget cuts are preventing rockets
from being built. The NASA director has instead suggested we get there
by standing people on each others shoulders.</p>
<p>Show an estimate for the number of persons standing on each others
shoulders that it would take to get to the moon. Clearly describe the
assumptions you are making. You will upload a video narration for this
assignment.</p>
<h1 id="unit-conversion-length-and-speed">3 Unit Conversion Length and
Speed</h1>
<p>You will upload a video narration for this assignment. There are two
parts to this question that you will write down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Express the quantity 5 meters in units of feet</li>
<li>Express the quantity 70 miles per hour in units of meters per
second</li>
<li>Your work and discussion should clearly indicate how you handled the
units</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="unit-conversion-birth-rate">4 Unit Conversion Birth Rate</h1>
<p>The worldwide crude birth rate is 18.5 births per 1000 people per
year. The world has a population of approximately 7.7 billion. What is
this birth rate in units of births per world per second?</p>
<p>Show you work using the factor-label method to make the units clear.
You will upload a video narration for this assignment.</p>
<h1 id="pemdas-symbolic">5 PEMDAS symbolic</h1>
<p>Which of these calculations, when typed into a spreadsheet, will
match the mathematical expression below? (Assume your calculator or
computer uses PEMDAS.) You will upload a screencast for this
assessment.</p>
<p>There could be multiple answers.</p>
<p><span class="math display"> \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} \cdot
\frac{e}{f} </span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a * c * e / b * d * f</li>
<li>a * c * e / (b * d * f)</li>
<li>a * c * e / b / d / f</li>
<li>(a * c * e) / (b / d / f)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="moon-spreadsheet">6 Moon Spreadsheet</h1>
<p>Create a spreadsheet that calculates your answer in the Moon
Shoulders estimation. Place each of the input quantities in their own
cells and put the output in its own cell. Label the quantities in each
cell to make the calculation more readable. In your screencast, show how
your answer changes when you put in different values. For your final
answer, use scientific notation formatting to show a reasonable number
of significant figures. (Also, for legibility, zoom the screencast
window on the cells you used instead of the entire spreadsheet.)</p>
<h1 id="base-conversion">7 Base Conversion</h1>
<p>Choose a (normal, base 10) number between 100–1000 and show how to
represent it in base 5 and base 8.</p>
<ul>
<li>show clearly how you went from the base 10 representation to the
other base representation
<ul>
<li>your narration must demonstrate that you understand your method</li>
</ul></li>
<li>draw a numberline for each representation and show two of the
neighboring numbers on each side for all three bases</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="scientific-notation">8 Scientific Notation</h1>
<p>When you represent these in normal decimal notation, how many zeros
does each have (between the lowest non-zero digit and the decimal
point)? Show how you arrived at your anwsers.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">4.0 \cdot 10^{37}</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">0.4 \cdot 10^{37}</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">4.123 \cdot 10^{37}</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Hint: Use a smaller number in the exponent to see the pattern and
then reason up to larger numbers. This is called induction.</p>
<h1 id="linear-relationship">9 Linear Relationship</h1>
<p>Find a news article describing a topic of interest that mentions a
relationship between two variables and write a short essay (~150 words)
covering the following points. (There is no video for this
assessment.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a link to the article and its title</li>
<li>Describe the units and dimensions of these two variables</li>
<li>Sketch a graph of the relationship (you make assume it is linear
over a small area)</li>
<li>Discuss what questions you can ask or answer using this
relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>To receive full credit the essay must</p>
<ul>
<li>meet the word length</li>
<li>demonstrate understanding of important concepts and issues</li>
<li>demonstrate engagement with the questions</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="unit-conversion-areas">10 Unit Conversion areas</h1>

equals 3.28 feet and one yard equals 3 feet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a square with the same area and label the length of the
sides.</li>
<li>Express this quantity in square feet</li>
<li>Express this quantity in square yards</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="unit-conversion-volumes">11 Unit Conversion Volumes</h1>
<p>You have 2.5 cubic meters of water. Use the fact that one meter

gallons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a cube with the same volume and label the length of the
sides</li>
<li>Express this in units of cubic feet</li>

</ul>
<h1 id="area-of-an-oil-slick">12 Area of an Oil Slick</h1>
<p>When oil is spilled in water, it creates a thin film of oil
approximately 1 micron (<span class="math inline">10^{-6}</span> meters)
thick that floats on the water. A barrel of oil is approximately 42
gallons of oil. If we spill a barrel of oil on the water, what is the
area covered by the oil slick</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a sketch showing the relevant dimensions.</li>
<li>State your answer in square meters.</li>
<li>State your answer in square kilometers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot directly convert between gallons (volume) and area using
a proportion because they are different dimensions.
<ul>
<li>(I’ve found calculators online “converting” gallons to area but I do
not understand why they exist. Its like saying I want to buy 10 gallons
of carpet.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You should imagine the oil slick as an imaginary box with a height
of 1 micron and use algebraic reasoning.</li>
</ul>

<li>draw with a linear y-axis</li>
<li>draw with a logarithmic y-axis</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-long-for-n-cases">14 How long for N cases?</h1>
<p>Imagine we are observing an illness where the cumulative number of
cases is follows the equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\textrm{cumulative cases} = A e^{b
t}</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">A</span> = 100 cases and <span
class="math inline">b</span> = 0.231 per day and <span
class="math inline">t</span> is the time since there were 100 cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a graph of these cases</li>
<li>Use the graph to make an estimate of the time <span
class="math inline">t</span> when there will be 100,000 cases
<ul>
<li>Be sure to explain your method clearly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optional: show your graphical estimate is equal to an algebraic
solution</li>
</ul>
