<h3>Million vs Billion vs Trillion</h3>
<p>One of the issues that has a profound affect on many aspects of life in America is extreme wealth inequality. The severity of this issue is poorly understood partly because of our failure to understand the difference between the units "million","billion" and "trillion" to describe dollar amounts.</p>
<p><b>a.</b> What year was it one million minutes ago?</p>
<p><b>b.</b> What year was it one billion minutes ago? Provide some context by describing two events in human history from this approximate period.</p>
<p><b>c.</b> What year was it one trillion minutes ago? Provide some context by describing this time in Earth's history from this approximate period.</p>

<h3>Computations</h3>
<p><b>a.</b> If you have traveled 100 miles in 2 hours, how fast are you going in miles per hour?</p>
<p><b>b.</b> If you record X births in a six month period with a population of 1 million, what is the birth rate in units of births per person per year?</p>
<p><b>c.</b> The specific heat capacity of a substance measures how well in maintains heat. The units for specific heat capacity are joules per gram per degree kelvin. If you observe a 10 Celsius temperature rise when 10,000 joules are added to 238 grams of water, what is the specific heat capacity in joules per gram per kelvin? You may need to up the conversion factor between degrees Kelvin and degrees Celsius.</p>
