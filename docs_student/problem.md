  <h1>What is a Problem?</h1>

  <p>
    It is important right from the beginning what is meant by a <b>problem</b> in this course.
    In the context of a math or science class, you may hear your professor ask you to do problems
    1 though 15 for homework. It is most likely not the case that your are being assigned 15
    "real" problems. The word "problem" is the context of a math class is often used to describe
    tasks that are essentitally exercises. <b>Exercises are not problems</b>.
  </p>

  <h2>Problems vs Exercises</h2>

  <p>
    Problems and exercises can both be challenging. The difference is an exercise is something you
    know how to do, in theory. An example of an exercise is a doing a pull-up. We know how to do a
    pull-up, but physically doing a pull-up is different that knowing how to do one. A pull-up can
    be easy or hard depending on your level of strength. An example of a math exercise would be
    performing <span>$9-4$</span> after a lesson on subtraction.
  </p>

  <p>
    A problem is something that you do not immediately know how to do. Examples of problems:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is the surface area of a cow?</li>
    <li>What is length of the California coastline?</li>
    <li>What is the current average temperature on the surface of the Earth?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Problems will likely involve using skills that we have developed through past exercises, but we
    have to figure out how and when to apply the skills. An additional issue is that problems that
    arise outside of a school setting, aka "real-life", are often poorly-structured and vague (see
    examples of problems above). 
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the goals in this course will be to develop problem solving techniques that we can apply
    to a wide range of problems. Even "real-life" problems!
