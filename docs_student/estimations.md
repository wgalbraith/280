<h1 id="estimations">Estimations</h1>
<p>We have previously come up with some decisions or issues that may
need an estimation. This section details some methods for arriving at
estimations when we don’t have clear data.</p>
<p>An estimation is our best attempt to quantify something about our
world. Often we have to do this with incomplete information and be
comfortable with the ambiguity.</p>
<p>An important part of the estimation process is letting go of the idea
that your answer will be “correct”. We often must make important
decisions without complete information. Your answer will be an imperfect
but useful estimation that will give us insight into a decision we are
making. You can ask yourself as you begin the estimation how accurate do
you need to be? This is a very different practice than many math
problems which have exact answers.</p>
<h1 id="situations">Situations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Deciding between two options
<ul>
<li>If your estimation of the benefit of these two options shows a clear
winner, you do not need a precise estimate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The absence of information
<ul>
<li>If you have no idea about a quantity a very rough estimate can be
valuable</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In this graph, we have the resource available, and the cost estimates
of two options. The bar heights are the estimate, and the error bars are
our best guess of the range of potential values of the value we are
estimating.</p>

<h1 id="necessary-accuracy">Necessary Accuracy</h1>
<p>Often a very crude estimation is sufficient for us to make a
decision. Usually, more accurate estimations require more time, effort,
and cost.</p>
<p>Imagine in the comparison graph, that option 1 and 2 were much closer
to the number for the resource available. If that were the case, we
would need a more accurate estimation to be sure we were making the
correct choice between options.</p>
<h1 id="estimation-general-recipe">Estimation General Recipe</h1>
<p>Here are some steps that can be useful as you develop
estimations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the problem</li>
<li>Take a guess</li>
<li>Identify the most important quantities</li>
<li>Detail the assumptions you are making</li>
<li>Estimate the value of these quantities</li>
<li>Set up the computation as clearly as possible</li>
<li>Execute the computation</li>
<li>Decide if the result is plausible</li>
<li>See if it matches your original guess</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="simple-example">Simple Example</h1>
<p>Imagine you are responsible for a catering order for an event and you
are ordering something like tacos or slices of pizza.</p>
<p>What do you need to know to place that order? Is the number of people
important? Is the size of the taco or slice important?</p>
<p>Once you have those quantities figured out, what computation will you
make? Will you add, multiply, or divide?</p>
<h1 id="decomposition">Decomposition</h1>
<p>We can think of the estimation as made up of other simpler
estimations.</p>
<p>Here is how we can think of the pizza estimation.</p>

<h1 id="more-complex-models">More complex models</h1>
<p>You also usually can not estimate your quantity directly, but must
instead break down your estimate into other smaller estimation problems
that can be tackled individually.</p>
<p>In the Art of Insight, Sanjoy Mahajan presents ways of determining
what estimations you need to make in your model. A useful tool is a tree
model.</p>
<p>This diagram is a tree model to help us determine the volume of a
dollar bill.</p>

<p>Note how we break up our goal estimation into smaller problems and
then work to determine if the smaller problems require further
decomposition.</p>
<h1 id="environmental-importance">Environmental Importance</h1>
<p>We can extend our simple catering model to more complex ideas. For
instance, what new assumptions would you add to figure out how much land
should be used for agriculture to provide for a city of 1 million
people? How about for a future planet of 10 billion people? How much
water would that require?</p>
<p>This is a much more complex model, but shares most of the simple
techniques we covered in the catering model.</p>
