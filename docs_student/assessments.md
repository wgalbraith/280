<p>Your screencast narration should be 30-60 seconds in length and address the following elements</p>
<ul>
<li>Your thought process for the problem</li>
<li>The changes in your thinking and mental models as you learned this material.</li>
<li>If this is a repeated attempt, discuss how your thinking has changed since the last attempt.</li>
</ul>
<p>For full credit, the work on the page must be correct and your narration must show evidence of your understanding.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-assignment-tips">Assessment Assignment Tips</h2>
<p>Here is a suggested workflow to create your video assignments for these. Let me know if you find apps or ideas that could help others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a photo or scan of your assignment, ensure it is legible.</li>
<li>Use Zoom (or other screencasting software) to create a video focused on the window with the scan.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tree-model">1 Tree Model</h1>
<p>Describe a simple model for a quantity of interest or importance to you. Draw a tree model that describes how the quantities fit together.</p>
<h1 id="ssu-estimation">2 SSU Estimation</h1>
<p>Come up with an estimate that involves all the students at SSU and describe a simple model to calculate it. Show how you computed your estimate and provide your estimate.</p>
<h1 id="moon-shoulders">3 Moon Shoulders</h1>
<p>We’d like to go to the moon, but budget cuts are preventing rockets from being built. The NASA director has instead suggested we get there by standing people on each others shoulders.</p>
<p>Show an estimate for the number of persons standing on each others shoulders that it would take to get to the moon. Clearly describe the assumptions you are making.</p>
<h1 id="unit-conversion-length-and-speed">4 Unit Conversion (Length and Speed)</h1>
<p>There are two parts to this question that you will write down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Express the quantity 5 meters in units of feet</li>
<li>Express the quantity 70 miles per hour in units of meters per second</li>
<li>Your work and discussion should clearly indicate how you handled the units</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="per-per-unit-conversion">5 Per Per Unit Conversion</h1>
<p>The worldwide crude birth rate is 18.5 births per 1000 people per year. The world has a population of approximately 7.7 billion. What is this birth rate in units of births per world per second?</p>
<p>Show you work using the factor-label method to make the units clear.</p>
<h1 id="base-conversion">6 Base Conversion</h1>
<p>Choose a (normal, base 10) number between 100–1000 and show how to represent it in base 5 and base 8.</p>
<ul>
<li>show clearly how you went from the base 10 representation to the other base representation</li>
<li>optional: draw a numberline for each representation and show two of the neighboring numbers on each side</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="scientific-notation">7 Scientific Notation</h1>
<p>When you represent these in normal decimal notation, how many zeros does each have (to the left of the decimal point)? Show how you arrived at your anwsers.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">4.0 \cdot 10^{37}</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">0.4 \cdot 10^{37}</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">4.123 \cdot 10^{37}</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pemdas-symbolic">8 PEMDAS symbolic</h1>
<p>Which of these matches the expression below? (Assume your calculator or computer uses PEMDAS.)</p>
<p>There could be multiple answers.</p>
<p><span class="math display"> \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} \cdot \frac{e}{f} </span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a * c * e / b * d * f</li>
<li>a * c * e / (b * d * f)</li>
<li>a * c * e / b / d / f</li>
<li>(a * c * e) / (b / d / f)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="computation-tools">9 Computation Tools</h1>
<p>Create a spreadsheet that performs the estimation you chose in Assessment 2. Place each of the input quantities in their own cells and put the output in its own cell. In your screencast, show how your answer changes when you put in different values. (Also, for legibility, zoom the screencast window on the cells you used instead of the entire spreadsheet.)</p>
<h1 id="area-of-an-oil-slick">10 Area of an Oil Slick</h1>
<p>When oil is spilled in water, it creates a thin film of water approximately 1 micron thick. A barrel of oil is approximately 42 gallons of oil. If we spill a barrel of oil on the water, what is the area covered by the oil slick</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a sketch showing the relevant dimensions.</li>
<li>State your answer in square meters.</li>
<li>State your answer in square kilometers.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="unit-conversion-areas">11 Unit Conversion areas</h1>
<p>You have an area of 900 square meters. Use the fact that one meter equals 3.28 feet and one yard equals 3 feet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a square with the same area.</li>
<li>Express this quantity in square feet</li>
<li>Express this quantity in square yards</li>
