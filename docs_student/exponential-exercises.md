- What features of the topic show that it fits the definition of exponential growth?  

## 3 Exponentials Metacognition

Look over the topics and exercises we have done so far.

- Which topics do you have the strongest understanding of?

## 4 Demonstrate Doubling Time

![](figures/exponentials/exponential-2.png)

For the graph above, demonstrate by showing at least 3 intervals on the graph, that the doubling time is 1.5 days.

## 5 Use Formula to Extrapolate

The mass of mold on my pizza is 2 grams right now. Mold scientists tell me it will grow according to the function

$$
\text{Mold (grams)} = 2 e^{0.08 t}
$$

where $t$ is the number of hours from now.

How many grams of mold will there be in twelve hours?

## 6 Extrapolate from Graph

![](figures/exponentials/exponential-ex-3.png)

For the graph above, if the growth rate does not change, what is the expected mass of mold after 6 days total.

## 7 Doubling Time Extrapolation

![](figures/exponentials/exponential-2.png)

For the graph above what is the mass of mold on day 6? (Time equals 6.0)

## 8 Which is Exponential (Linear Scale)

![](figures/exponentials/which-is-exponential-linear.png)

Which of the above graphs is exponential?

- A  
- B  
- Both A and B  
- Neither A nor B  

Explain the reasoning behind your selection.

## 9 Which is Exponential (Log Scale)

![](figures/exponentials/which-is-exponential-log.png)

Which of the above graphs is exponential? Discuss the reasons for your decision.

- A (yes or no)  
- B (yes or no)  
- C (yes or no)  

## 10 Doubling Time (Log Scale)

![](figures/exponentials/doubling-time-log-graph.png)

Please find and report the doubling time for this graph. How is it different from a linear-scale graph?

## 11 Forward or Inverse to Find Amount

Using the graph for **7 Doubling Time Extrapolation**:

- Estimate the time at which the mass of mold is 15 grams and 30 grams.  
- If you were to do this analytically (using formulas) do you need an inverse (log) function or the exponential function to find the amount?  

## 12 Forward or Inverse to Find Time

Using the graph for **7 Doubling Time Extrapolation**:

- Estimate the mass of mold at day 1 and day 2.  
- If you were to do this analytically (using formulas) do you need an inverse (log) function or the exponential function to find the time?  

## 13 Estimates (Linear Scale)

You have the following graph. At what time will we reach 27 grams of mold?

## 14 Estimates (Log Scale)

You have the following graph. When does the mass equal 7 grams?

![](figures/exponentials/estimates-log.png)

## 15 Inverse base $e$

We have the expression for mold growth of

$$
\text{mass} = A \cdot e^{b t}
$$

where $A = 2$ grams and $b = 0.08/\text{hours}$.

How long until I have 20 grams of mold?

## 16 Inverse base 10

$$
\text{mass} = A \cdot 10^{b \cdot t}
$$

where $A = 2$ grams and $b = 0.1/\text{hours}$.

How long until I have 50 grams of mold?

## 17 Draw Your Own Log Scale

On a piece of paper

- create four evenly spaced marks  
- for each of these marks, write 1, 10, 100, 1000  
- halfway between each of those marks, write another mark  

What number goes on each of these new marks?

## 18 Create Spreadsheet Graph

In this exercise you’ll use a spreadsheet to graph an exponential function

- Make a table of data with $x$ and $y$ values  
- Create a chart with a linear $y$-scale  
- Create a chart with a log $y$-scale  

## 19 Logarithmic Scale Roots

Using a logarithmic scale, find the square root of 100, 1000, and the cube root of 100 and 1000.

Show the distances on a scale.

## 20 Determine if Exponential or Not

Using the provided spreadsheet file, use a spreadsheet to determine if the data is exponential or not.

Describe the test you used for the data.

**Challenge:** Determine the formula for the non-exponential data

# 21 Estimate Logarithm with Distance

Show how to estimate the logarithm of a number between 20 and 90 using a logarithmic scale on paper and a length measurement.

- Choose your own number  
- Show the base 10 logarithm  
- Show the natural logarithm  
- Show explicitly how the measured lengths in mm can be converted to the logarithm  

# 22 Draw Linear and Log Scales

This uses the log and linear scale handout.

- Which scale is linear, a or b?  
- Which scale is logarithmic, a or b?  
- Use a ruler and mark the locations of 2.5, 4, 7, 10, and 15 on the linear scale.  
- Use a ruler and mark the locations of 4, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 80, 100, 125, and $\sqrt{8}$  

# 23 Exponential Graph from Scales

Use a logarithmic scale for this exercise.

- Measure the length between 1 and $e$ on the logarithmic scale  
- Mark out a linear scale where 1 data equals this length  
- Label the logarithmic scale as $y$ and the linear scale as $x$  
- Make a table of $x$ and $y$ values according to your scales  
- Plot this out  

For practice do this again for other values besides $e$.
