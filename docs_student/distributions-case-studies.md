<p>The CalEnviroScreen data set compiles various pollution, health, and
demographic data for each census tract in California.</p>
<p>The data is available in the raw form in a spreadsheet and the CES
website creates maps that color-code the data.</p>
<p>The CES maps are a version of a choropleth map. These choropleth maps
use color to show the percentile of each area in the overall data set of
California census tracts.</p>
<p>Note that there are at least two ways where these data are summarized
and lose detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>The overall score is a composite of all of the pollution and health
factors.</li>
<li>The score for a geographic area is over the entire census
tract.</li>
</ul>
