Example</h1>
<p>Imagine we want to lower the exposure of children to lead from paint
in homes.</p>
<p>Your team has suggested repainting the interior of homes with known
lead paint to prevent exposure.</p>
<p>Your team decides to try it on 100 homes and quantify the result.</p>
<p>Your population is the blood lead levels of children living in homes
with lead paint. Let’s assume that we’ve measured lots of children in
homes with lead paint and we know that the mean level of lead is 5 ug/dL
and that the standard deviation is 2 ug/dL.</p>
<p>That population distribution looks like this: <img
src="figures/populations/lead-population-distribution.svg"
style="width:100.0%" data-max-width="300px" /><br />
</p>
<p>Our question is: “Does repainting lower lead levels in children.” Our
null hypothesis is: “Repainting does not affect lead levels.”</p>
<p>Our sample is 100 children in homes that have been repainted.</p>
<p>After repainting these homes and measuring the children, the mean
lead level of the 100 children is 4.5 ug/dL.</p>
<p>To determine if this is likely or unlikely under the null hypothesis,
we use the sampling distribution.</p>
<p>According to the central limit theorem, the sampling distribution
will have the same mean and the standard error (standard deviation of
the sampling distribution) will be narrower (confirm this by using our formula for SE).</p>

<p>That sampling distribution looks like this: <img
src="figures/populations/lead-sampling-distribution.svg"
style="width:100.0%" data-max-width="300px" /><br />
</p>
<p>The probability of this mean of 100 children being below 4.5 ug/dL is
represented by the shaded area and is quite small.</p>
