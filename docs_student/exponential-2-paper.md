<h1 id="identifying-exponential-behavior">Identifying Exponential
Behavior</h1>
<p>We often want to know if something we are measuring is exhibiting
exponential growth.</p>
<p>We do this by looking at the data.</p>
<p>Since our definition of exponential growth is that for a set interval
on the x-axis, we multiply by a constant number on the y-axis.</p>
<p>We can then look at our graph or data for this behavior.</p>
<h1 id="ratios">Ratios</h1>
<p>For the following graph, we see that every time the number on the
x-axis increases by one, we multiply by two on the y-axis. This is clear
for x-values of 0, 1, 2, and 3 but it is also true for all other
x-values.</p>

<p>For any graph, you can look at the ratio between points and see if it
is constant, if it is, that graph is showing exponential growth.</p>
<h1 id="straight-line-on-a-log-scale">Straight Line on a Log Scale</h1>
<p>If we plot our data on a logarithmic scale, these ratios will be
represented by equal distances and the data will lie on a straight
line.</p>
<p>When data lie on a straight line when the x-axis is a linear scale
and the y-axis is a log scale, the data is exponential.</p>
