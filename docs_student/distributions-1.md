<h1 id="histograms-and-distributions">Histograms and Distributions</h1>
<p>So far, we have focused on single estimates. How much volume is this tank, how long is this room, etc. Now we ask questions about several objects at once.</p>
<ul>
<li>How tall are the students in this class?</li>
<li>How big are the classes at my university?</li>
<li>How big are the departments at my university?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we are interested in the behavior of a single variable. Is it evenly distributed or are some values more present than others? What are the largest and smallest values?</p>
<h2 id="characterizing-a-body-of-data">Characterizing a body of data</h2>
<p>We often ask two questions about data. The first is what is the central tendency or do the data point to some sort of majority value. The second is how tightly clustered are the data. Does the data range widely?</p>
<h2 id="mean-or-average">Mean or Average</h2>
<p>A common measure of the central tendency is the mean. If we take a list of data, sum the values, and divide by the number of data we get the mean or the average.</p>
<h2 id="median">Median</h2>
<p>Another measure of the central tendency is the median. The median is the value at which half the data has a value below the median and half the data has a value above it.</p>
<h2 id="standard-deviation">Standard Deviation</h2>
<p>The standard deviation is a measure of how dense or spare the data are around the central tendency.</p>
<h2 id="histogram">Histogram</h2>
<p>A common tool for looking at single-variable (univariate) data is a histogram.</p>
<p>A histogram</p>
<ul>
<li>Shows data of a single quantitative continuous variable</li>
<li>Shows the value of that data on the x-axis</li>
<li>Divides the x-axis into evenly spaced bins</li>
<li>On the y-axis shows the number of values in each bin</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="types-of-data">Types of Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nominal data has no quantitative value.
<ul>
<li>Examples include state of birth, blood type, political affiliation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ordinal data has a number and order but isn’t continuous
<ul>
<li>Example: survey question 1 for very unsatisfied, 5 for very satisfied</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Continuous data: data that can take any value
<ul>
<li>Example: length, mass</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
