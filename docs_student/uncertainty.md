<ul>
<li>Most math problems you have seen have been carefully created for you to solve them exactly</li>
<li>Most problems that need to be solved are not so tidy</li>
<li>Physicist Enrico Fermi was famous for posing these types of questions</li>
<li>Precise vs Approximate reasoning</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t always know quantities precisely. We also don’t always need to know the results of our estimations precisely. We will get comfortable with working with lots of uncertainty in our estimates.</p>

<li>What is 1 + 1?</li>
<li>What is 10 + 1?</li>
<li>What is one thousand + 1?</li>
<li>What is one million + 1?</li>
<li>We see that adding one doesn’t matter in some cases.</li>

<li>For many problems, only the first digit and the number of zeros is important</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="easier-multiplication">Easier Multiplication</h2>
<ul>
<li>Imagine we want to multiply several large numbers but only want a rough approximation.</li>
<li>How can we do that?</li>

<h2 id="significant-figures">Significant Figures</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each significant figure that we add to the multiplication affects the accuracy less than the previous</li>
