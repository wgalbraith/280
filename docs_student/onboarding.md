<h1 id="assignments-on-canvas">Assignments on Canvas</h1>
<p>We have a few digital formats for our course assignments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Worksheet</li>
<li>Typed Assignments and Forum Posts</li>
<li>Scans and Photos</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cloud-worksheet">Cloud Worksheet</h1>
<p>In Canvas you can find a link to our shared spreadsheet. We use this
in class to share our answers or thoughts with each other in a simple
spreadsheet. You will usually place your name or team name and responses
in the provided column.</p>
<h1 id="typed-assignments-and-forum-posts">Typed Assignments and Forum
Posts</h1>
<p>Many of our assignments ask you to write short essays on topics and
post them as assignments or forum posts. You will find the links for
these in the current module in Canvas.</p>
<p>Make sure you are able to post images that are visible in the
discussion.</p>
<h1 id="canvas-notifications">Canvas Notifications</h1>
<p>You can opt-in and opt-out of Canvas messages to fit your needs.</p>
<h1 id="scans-and-photos">Scans and Photos</h1>
<p>We will frequently write our mathematics on paper and then convert to
digital format. Most students snap a photo with their phone and then
canvas can access either the camera or your photos. This can also be
done with a laptop.</p>
<p>Note: set your iphones to JPG in settings/camera/formats and choose
most compatible. This is because HEIC is not supported by Canvas.</p>
