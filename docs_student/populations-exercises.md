<h1 id="ces-subpopulation-spreadsheet-preparation">6 CES Subpopulation
Spreadsheet Preparation</h1>
<p>In this exercises, we will plan out a spreadsheet computation to find
the difference in means between a CES indicator for an entire population
and for a subpopulation. You can refer to the notes for a reminder of
how the query to make a sample works.</p>
<p>Make a copy of the data at <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V_MBnjbgTLKwyBk8HY16ue8EqiOIB9M4_ZWZSrZlnnk/edit?usp=sharing">this
link</a> in your Google Drive account. (For this exercise, we’ll use the
CES 3.0 data set.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Write your hypothesis and a null hypothesis you would like to
test</li>
<li>Choose a variable you are interested in and note the name and
column</li>
<li>Choose another variable to create a sample or subpopulation and note
the name and column</li>
<li>Describe the numerical condition you will use to create your
subpopulation</li>
<li>Describe, in words, the query you’ll use to create your
subpopulation</li>
<li>Briefly say why you chose your variable and subpopulation and what
you expect to find</li>
<li>Describe how you will compute the standard error from your
population and subpopulation</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="define-terms">7 Define Terms</h1>
<p>In the upcoming class, we will quantify the likelihood that the
differences in means you observed in assignment 6 could have occurred at
random. In that context, define the following terms using your choices
in assignment 6.</p>
<ul>
<li>total population</li>
<li>subpopulation(s)</li>
<li>population mean</li>
<li>sample mean</li>
<li>standard deviation</li>
<li>standard error</li>
