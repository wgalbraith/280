economic, or other) you think might have an association or
correlation.</li>

<h1 id="linear-relationships">2 Linear relationships</h1>
<p>Revisit your list of 10 potentially linear relationships from the
Ellenberg Chapter 1 exercise. You are welcome to remove or add topics to
your list. Imagine you are planning to gather data for these to
understand the kind of relationship. You don’t need to gather data or
estimate the slope. For at least 3 of them specify</p>
<ul>
<li>What quantity is on the x-axis (the independent quantity)? What are
its units and dimensions?</li>
<li>What quantity is on the y-axis (the dependent quantity)? What are
its units and dimensions?</li>
<li>What are the units and dimensions of the slope?</li>
<li>In a sentence, write a question that you could ask or answer with
this relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="linear-notes">3 Linear Notes</h1>
<p>Please read the notes for
this section and answer the following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can you determine the units and dimensions of a slope?</li>
<li>Does the slope change in a linear graph?</li>

<p>You can represent the unit conversion from miles to meters as a
linear graph.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a graph of the unit conversion going from miles to meters.</li>
<li>Label the x and y axes and put numbers for the reader to use.</li>
<li>Show from 0–10 miles on the x-axis.</li>
<li>Show how the unit conversion is the slope.</li>
<li>Show how to use the graph to make an estimation.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="taco-estimation">5 Taco Estimation</h1>
<p>You can represent the previous exercise we did on tacos at SSU.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a graph that shows tacos needed for a number of students.</li>
<li>Show from 0–20,000 students on the x-axis.</li>
<li>Show the units of the slope.</li>
<li>Show how the formula and the graph is related.</li>
<li>Show how to use the graph to make an estimation.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pizza-formula">6 Pizza Formula</h1>
<p>A Rafy’s large cheese pizza is 16 USD and 2 USD for each topping.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a formula for the cost of a large cheese pizza</li>
<li>Sketch a graph showing the price for up to 4 toppings</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="modern-keeling-curve">7 Modern Keeling Curve</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/">Keeling Curve</a> is the
carbon dioxide concentration that has been observed at the Mauna Loa
Observatory since the late 1950s.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe what you think is important about the slope of the Keeling
Curve.</li>
<li>What is the approximate slope of the carbon dioxide concentration in
units of ppm per year from 2010 to 2020?</li>
<li>If the carbon dioxide emissions continue at the 2010–2020 rate, what
concentration do we expect in 2050?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./figures_static/linear/keeling-curve.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="early-20th-century-keeling-curve">8 Early 20th Century Keeling
Curve</h1>
<p>A record of carbon dioxide concentrations from 1700 to the present is
available at the <a href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/">Keeling Curve
website</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe what you think is important about the slope of the carbon
dioxide concentration curve from the 1700s until now.</li>
<li>What is the approximate slope of the carbon dioxide concentration in
units of ppm per year from 1900 to 1950.</li>
<li>If we had continued at the 1900–1950 rate, what would the
concentration be now?</li>

<h1 id="taco-estimation-graph">9 Taco Estimation Graph</h1>
<p>Using your taco estimation, create a spreadsheet that</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a column for the number of people</li>
<li>Has a column that calculates the number of tacos</li>
<li>Creates a graph from the people and tacos column</li>
</ul>
<p>Upload a screenshot showing the graph and your formulas.</p>
<h1 id="unit-conversion-scale">10 Unit Conversion Scale</h1>

units. Choose your own unit conversion from this list (meters to yards,
square feet to square meters, kilograms to pounds, or liters to
gallons).</p>

5, or 10 are common)</li>
<li>State clearly the conversion for each unit to distance on the
page</li>

5, or 10 are common)</li>
<li>State clearly the conversion for each unit to distance on the
page</li>
