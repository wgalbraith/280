<h1 id="linear-concepts">Linear Concepts</h1>
<p>We model many relationships between quantities as a linear function
or straight line.</p>
<p>Even if the relationship between two quantities is not a straight
line, a straight line is a good model that allows good predictions in a
small area. For example, the earth is round but using a flat model is
useful for building things.</p>
<p>In a linear model for a given change anywhere in the independent
variable (x-axis) there is the same change in the independent
variable.<br />
This is equivalent to saying the slope is the same anywhere in the
relationship.</p>
<p>Linear relationships are defined by a straight line when graphed and
allow easy prediction.</p>
<h1 id="implications-of-linear-relationships">Implications of Linear
Relationships</h1>
<ul>
<li>What sorts of questions can you answer with a linear function?</li>
<li>What is the significance of a change in the slope?</li>
<li>Can part of a graph be linear and others not?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="diminishing-returns">Diminishing Returns</h1>
<p>For many relationships between quantities in nature, at some point
the slope decreases.</p>
<p>We should be aware of where this point is if we want effective
actions.</p>
<p>For example, say you have 24 hours until an exam. How many hours
should you study? Imagine there is a positive slope at first with hours
studying on the x-axis and the exam grade on the y-axis. At some point,
more hours studying won’t raise the grade and could even lower it if you
end up sleep-deprived.</p>

## Association/Correlation

Linear graphs usually demonstrate an association or correlation.
- Two variables are correlated when the change in one variable results in a predictable change in the other variable. -->
<h2 id="independent-variable">Independent Variable</h2>
<ul>
<li>The variable we can manipulate</li>
<li>The variable we want to see the effect of changing</li>
<li>Placed on the x-axis</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dependent-variable">Dependent Variable</h2>
<ul>
<li>The variable we observe when we manipulate the independent
variable</li>
<li>Placed on the y-axis</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="slope">Slope</h2>
<p>This quantity relates a change in the independent variable to the
change in the dependent variable.</p>
