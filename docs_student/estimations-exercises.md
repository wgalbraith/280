<h1 id="vibes-and-evidence">1 Vibes and Evidence</h1>
<p>Write a short essay (50-150 words) on the following questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify one real-world issue that you believe is important?</li>
<li>Describe the opinions, attitudes, or general “vibes” that you or others have about this issue.</li>
<li>Explain what kinds of evidence (data, studies, statistics, observations, etc.) could help people, including yourself, form a more informed opinion about the issue?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="quantitative-argument-notes">2 Quantitative Argument Notes</h1>
<p>Using ideas from Chapter 2, respond to the questions below. This activity is meant to encourage broad thinking, so there are no single correct answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe a decision (personal, social, or policy-related) that you think should be based on quantitative evidence.
<ul>
<li>Explain whether this decision currently uses data or evidence, and if so, what kind?</li>
<li>Discuss what could be improved about how evidence is used in this decision.</li>
<li>Identify any important information or data that may be missing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1> For the estimation problems (#3-#7), provide a clearly stated list of assumptions, and a final quantitative estimate with a reasonable margin of error.  You may use internet resources to find any intermediate quantities you need (SSU enrollment, the weight of paper, atomic weights, etc).

<h1 id="how-many-tacos">3 How many tacos</h1>
<p>You are purchasing enough tacos to feed Sonoma State students at a
campus-wide event for lunch today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimate the number of tacos the caterer should bring.</li>
<li>Clearly list all the assumptions you are making to arrive at your estimate.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ssu-holding-hands">4 SSU Holding Hands</h1>
<p>You are creating a viral video event where every student at Sonoma
State holds hands in a long chain. You need to ask the RoPo police to
block a lane of traffic on the roads.</p>
<p>What length of road in feet or miles should you ask them to
reserve.</p>
<h1 id="books">5 Weight of Books</h1>
<p>How heavy is a moving box full of books?</p>
<h1 id="books">6 Mass of Air</h1>
<p>What is the mass of air in your bedroom?</p>
<h1 id="books">7 Have you Got the Money?</h1>
<p>In the movies, and perhaps in reality, cocaine and elections are bought with suitcases containing $100 bills.</p>
<li>What is the dollar value in such a suitcase.</li>
<li>What is the weight of such a suitcase?</li>
<h1 id="associations">8 Associations</h1>
<p>Recall that an association between a cause and an effect is one of
the conditions for causality. For this exercise, find an example in a
popular or journal article of a statistical association in an area of
interest to you.</p>
<p>Write a short 100-word report that adresses the points below:</p>
<li>Comment on whether the cause is categorical or quantitiative. If it is quanitative is it discrete or continuous</li>
<li>Comment on whether the cause is categorical or quantitiative. If it is quanitative is it discrete or continuous</li>
<li>Clearly explain on what the data points represent.</li>
<li>Does it appear that the study you chose suggests a cause-and-effect relationship or simply an association?</li>
<li>If there is simply an association, i.e. there is no evidence of causal relationship, identify a confounding variable that may be related to the explanatory and response variables.</li>
<li>Provide a citation for the study. If you found it online, just provide the URL.</li>
</ul>
