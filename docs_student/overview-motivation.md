<h1 id="motivation">Introduction to Quantitative Analysis</h1>

<blockquote> 

<p>A great discovery solves a great problem but there is a grain of discovery in the
solution of any problem. Your problem may be modest; but if it challenges your
curiosity and brings into play your inventive faculties, and if you solve it by your
own means, you may experience the tension and enjoy the triumph of discovery.- George P&oacute;lya, "How to Solve It"</p>

<h1 id="overview">What is quantitative analysis?</h1>
<p>
Quantitative analysis is an approach to understanding our world through the use of numerical data, mathematical models, and statistical methods. Rather than relying primarily on descriptive or interpretive accounts, quantitative analysis attempts to measure patterns, relationships, and processes.
</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Why do we need a course in quantitative analysis?</h1>
<h2 id="quantitative-analysis-is-a-powerful-tool">Quantitative analysis is a powerful tool for change</h2>
<ul>
<li>What changes do you want to make in the world?</li>
<li>Quantitative analysis provides evidence for whether policies or interventions are effective.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="quantitative-analysis-can-improve-your-mental-models">Quantitative analysis can improve your intuition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our intuitive understanding about our physical world is incomplete, and sometimes wrong.</li>
<li>Quantitative analysis helps identify and eliminate incorrect beliefs. </li>
<li>When we can eliminate incorrect beliefs, we can build a more accurate models of the physical world.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quantitative-skills-inoculate-you-from-bad-faith-arguments">Quantitative skills inoculate you from bad arguments</h1>
<p>
We need to develop tools to help us evaluate the validity of arguments.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the argument logically sound?</li>
<li>Are the mathematical or statistical claims valid?</li>
<li>Are the assumptions underlying the analysis reasonable assumptions?</li>
<li>What alternative explanations could account for the same evidence?</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, bad-faith arguments, i.e. deliberately false but plausible claims are increasingly common, particularly when misinformation can generate profit. Quantitative skills sharpen critical thinking and help distinguish misleading arguments from credible evidence.</p> 

<h1 id="overview">When do we use quantitative analysis?</h1>

<p>Humans regularly make decisions involving quantitative analysis. From everyday questions like “What will it cost to
take a vacation in Italy?”, to policy questions like “How does a carbon taxing scheme affect atmospheric carbon levels?". 
Our answer to either question will be limited by two factors: (1) The information, aka data, we have, and (2) our ability to accurately, and meaningfully, analyze the data .  In this course, we focus on the latter.</p>

<p>Due to the incomplete data usually inherent in quantitative questions about our world, the answers to these questions usually cannot be determined <i>precisely</i>. However, they can be answered <i>accurately</i> if we have the following: Good data, a good estimate, a margin of error.</p>

While the data gathering step is a prerequisite for a solid analysis, this course does <b> not </b> address data collection. We will focus on how to 

<ul>
<li>find the best estimates for the quantities we are estimating</li>
<li>quantifying how much uncertainty surrounds these estimates (margin of error), if possible</li>
<li>communicating our results</li>
</ul>
