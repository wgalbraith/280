<h1 id="wheelan-regression-reading">1 Wheelan Regression Reading</h1>
<p>Please read the chapter on regression by Charles Wheelan and answer
the following questions.<br />
<a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bylswmqhwpxjeaw/Wheelan-NS-12-Regression.pdf?dl=0">Here
is a link to the reading.</a></p>
<p>Pick two examples of relationships that you’d be interested in
exploring. They could be from the CalEnviroScreen data or anywhere
else.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the independent variable?</li>
<li>What is the dependent variable?</li>
<li>What does each data point represent?</li>
<li>If there is a relationship, what are the implications?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="relationships">2 Relationships</h1>
<p>Come up with five relationships that you could explore with a linear
model with noise.</p>
<p>For each relationship, clearly state the x-axis (independent
variable), the y-axis (dependent variable), and the meaning of the
slope, and why the relationship is important.</p>
<p>Also, pick one of these to briefly describe at the start of the next
class.</p>
<h1 id="calenviroscreen-relationships">3 CalEnviroScreen
Relationships</h1>
<p>Look at the CalEnviroscreen measurements and write about two
relationships you are curious about. For each, answer the following
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the independent variable?</li>
<li>What is the dependent variable?</li>
<li>What does each data point represent?</li>
<li>What does the slope represent?</li>
<li>Why do you think this might be a linear relationship?</li>
<li>What do you think are the implications of this relationship? What
should we do based on the relationship?</li>
</ul>
