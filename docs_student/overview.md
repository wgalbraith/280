<h1 id="overview">What is Quantitative Analysis?</h1>
<p>
Quantitative analysis is an approach to understanding geographic and environmental phenomena through the use of numerical data, mathematical models, and statistical methods. Rather than relying primarily on descriptive or interpretive accounts, quantitative analysis seeks to measure patterns, relationships, and processes in a way that allows for comparison, replication, and inference.

We need to develop tools to help us evaluate the validity of arguments.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the argument logically sound?</li>
<li>Are the mathematical or statistical claims valid?</li>
<li>Are the assumptions underlying the analysis reasonable assumptions?</li>
<li>What alternative explanations could account for the same evidence?</li>
</ul>

Additionally, bad-faith arguments, i.e. deliberately false but plausible claims are increasingly common, particularly when misinformation can generate profit. Quantitative skills sharpen critical thinking and help distinguish misleading arguments from credible evidence.
