# Creek Flow Estimation

We can model the water flow in the creek as a box of water sliding down the creek bed.

Measurements:

- cross sectional area of creek
  - length across the creek
  - depth of creek
- water velocity in creek
  - length along creek
  - time for floating object to travel this length

Note that if you multiply the cross sectional area by the velocity you get a flow rate.

$$ \textrm{area} \cdot \textrm{velocity} $$
$$ \textrm{length} \cdot \textrm{length} \cdot \frac{\textrm{length}}{\textrm{time}} $$
$$ \frac{\textrm{volume}}{\textrm{time}} $$

# Strategy

- Write a diagram of your model in your notes
- Measure/estimate the properties of the creek
- Record these estimates and their units clearly in your notes
- Plug these estimates into the model and make a flow estimate.
- Check your flow estimate against the [USGS measurement](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/11465660/#parameterCode=00060&period=P7D&showMedian=false).
