  <h1>Problem Solving Techniques</h1>

  <p>
    Problem solving is the process of moving from a situation you do not yet understand to a plan
    you can carry out, and then to a solution you can justify. Unlike routine exercises, real
    problems rarely come with a clear recipe. They may be vague, messy, or missing information.
    The goal of learning problem solving techniques is not to memorize one “right method,” but to
    build habits that help you make progress when the path is uncertain.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Understand the Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Start by clarifying what is being asked. Restate the problem in your own words, identify the
    goal, and list what you know. If something is unclear, write down questions that would make it
    clearer. Many mistakes happen because people begin solving before they fully understand the
    task.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Organize Information</h2>
  <p>
    Create a simple structure for the information you have. This might include a labeled sketch,
    a table, a list of key facts, or a map. Define important terms and decide what quantities or
    features matter. If the problem involves change, note what changes and what stays the same.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Break It Into Smaller Parts</h2>
  <p>
    Large problems become manageable when divided into smaller questions. Ask: “What would I need
    to know first?” or “Can I solve a simpler version of this?” Solving a related, easier problem
    often reveals a strategy for the original one.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Look for Patterns and Relationships</h2>
  <p>
    Many solutions come from noticing how parts of a problem connect. Compare cases, test small
    examples, and look for repeated structure. If the problem includes data, examine trends or
    relationships. If it is spatial, consider how location and distance matter.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Choose a Strategy and Make a Plan</h2>
  <p>
    Good problem solvers try approaches deliberately. Common strategies include drawing a diagram,
    making a table, working backward from the goal, testing extreme cases, or using estimation to
    check whether an answer is reasonable. Write down a short plan before doing detailed work.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Carry Out the Plan Carefully</h2>
  <p>
    Execute your steps with attention to detail. Keep your work organized so you can see what you
    did and why. If you get stuck, pause and reassess: Did you misunderstand the problem? Is there
    a different representation that would help (a diagram instead of words, or a table instead of a
    list)? Trying a second approach is normal, not a failure.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Check and Communicate the Result</h2>
  <p>
    After you reach a result, test it. Does it make sense in the context of the problem? Can you
    explain it clearly to someone else? Check units, compare to estimates, and consider whether
    alternative answers are possible. A solution is stronger when it is supported by reasoning, not
    just a final number or statement.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this course, you will practice these techniques across many types of problems. Over time,
    the aim is to become comfortable with uncertainty, to develop flexible strategies, and to build
    confidence in your ability to make progress—even when there is no obvious starting point.
