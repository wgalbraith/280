<!-- # Statistics

So far we have learned how to estimate or model a single thing or event.
Statistics gives us tools to understand multiple measurements from a group of objects.

We will focus on the application of statistics to problems of environment and environmental justice.
Particularly, statistics allows us to elucidate patterns and provide evidence of the causes.

We will be using two data sets from California to ask questions and gather evidence.

We'll start with a brief discussion of causality. -->
<h1 id="causality">Causality</h1>
<p>Here are a few questions that require the establishment of
causality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does pollution cause health problems?</li>
<li>Do green taxes reduce pollution?</li>
<li>Is discrimination contributing to health problems?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="establishing-causality">Establishing Causality</h2>
<p>To establish evidence of causality, we need to establish three
factors</p>
<ul>
<li>Association</li>
<li>Time order</li>
<li>Non-spuriousness and mechanism</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="association">Association</h2>
<p>The association between two measured quantities is quantified by
correlation. This correlation is a key tool provided by statistics.</p>
<h2 id="time-order">Time order</h2>
<p>The cause must occur before the observed effect.</p>
<h2 id="mechanism">Mechanism</h2>
<p>The association must have some mechanism that explains how the cause
could lead to the effect.</p>
<p>If we do not have a mechanism, it is possible that we have a spurious
(false) relationship.</p>
<h2 id="spurious-relationships">Spurious relationships</h2>
<p>Spurious relationships can have associations and time order but no
mechanism to link them. They often are both related to another more
important variable.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ice cream and violent crime.</li>
<li>Breath mints and lung cancer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="causality-revisited">Causality Revisited</h2>
<p>So statistics provides evidence of a time-order and an association,
but we must often rely on a branch of science to suggest a
mechanism.</p>
<p>Biochemistry might show that a chemical damages human tissue in a way
that could lead to disease.</p>
<h1 id="counterfactual">Counterfactual</h1>
<p>When we test an intervention, we want to establish what would have
happened in the absence of that intervention. This is called a
counterfactual.</p>
<p>In a lab setting we can create a control group.</p>
<p>In the environmental and social sciences, creating this
counterfactual can be more subtle.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-studies">Types of Studies</h1>
<h2 id="field-work">Field Work</h2>
<p>These are studies in the “real world”.</p>
<h2 id="laboratory-studies">Laboratory Studies</h2>
<p>These are studies in laboratories that attempt to simulate parts of
our world or environment.</p>
<h2 id="cross-sectional-study">Cross-sectional Study</h2>
<p>A study that looks at a number of individuals (population) at a
specific point in time.</p>
<p>Usually tries to use random methods to reflect the entire
population.</p>
<h2 id="longitudinal-study">Longitudinal Study</h2>
<p>A study that measures something over a long period of time.</p>
<p>These studies often look for changes that can be related to an event
or change in an environment.</p>
