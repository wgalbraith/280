<h1 id="quantities">Quantities</h1>
<p>When we use mathematics to model the physical world, we need additional tools to represent physical quantities. A number only gives a magnitude. When we combine that number with a unit (length, mass) it becomes a quantity that can represent something physical.</p>
<h2 id="dimensions-units-quantities">Dimensions, units, quantities</h2>
<ul>
<li>A quantity represents a physical measurement like mass, length or amount of energy</li>
<li>We represent a quantity with a number and a unit</li>
<li>The dimension of a quantity is different than the unit</li>
<li>For example 1 inch is the same as 2.54 centimeters even though 1 and 2.54 are not the same number</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="physical-quantities">Physical Quantities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our numbers are often helping us represent physical quantities</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>The length of a tree</li>
<li>The number of animals observed</li>
<li>The number of molecules of mercury in a fish</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A physical quantity is expressed as the product of a unit and a numerical factor</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>These physical quantities often have a dimension</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Length</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Mass</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In our estimations, we may have quantities that are not in fundamental units such as length or time. For example, we may be counting a population of animals, or the number of power plants needed.</p>
<!-- physics have 7 primary dimensions, we may have others -->
<h2 id="units">Units</h2>
<ul>
<li>To quantify dimensions, we use units</li>
<li>One dimension may have multiple units</li>
<li>Length: inches, miles, kilometers, light-years</li>
<li>Mass: grams, pounds, kilograms</li>
<li>There are also systems of units like SI or English</li>
</ul>
<!-- what are some units and some unusual units -->
<!-- clicks, bytes, click velocity -->
<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each measurement we make is an estimation of the physical quantity</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>NASA Mars Climate Orbiter destroyed because of newton vs pounds of force</li>
<li>A cargo flight was lost in 1999 when crew confused meters and feet</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unit-conversion-factors">Unit conversion factors</h2>
<ul>
<li>These factors are equivalent to one or unity and are dimensionless</li>
<li>They are not numerically equal to one in most cases.</li>
<li>Units can be crossed out</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unit-conversion-factors-1">Unit conversion factors</h2>
<ul>
<li>These factors are equivalent to one or unity and are dimensionless</li>
<li>They are not numerically equal to one in most cases.</li>
<li>Units can be crossed out</li>
<li>They can have units but be dimensionless</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="different-dimensions">Different Dimensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>You cannot convert a quantity with one dimension to another dimension with a unit conversion factor</li>
<li>There may be a linear relationship between those two quantities that looks like a “conversion” but isn’t</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unit-conversion-factors-2">Unit conversion factors</h2>
<p>These two quantities are equal.</p>
<p><span class="math display"> 3 \textrm{feet} = 1 \textrm{yard} </span></p>
<p>If we divide both sides by 3 feet, we get</p>
<p><span class="math display"> 1 = \frac{1\ \textrm{yard}}{3\ \textrm{feet}}  </span></p>
<p>Note that this quantity has units of yard per feet, but has no dimensions since it is a length divided by a length. If you multiply a quantity of feet by this, you won’t change the quantity but you will change the units.</p>
<h2 id="two-units-in-the-denominator">Two units in the denominator</h2>
<ul>
<li>Births per capita per year</li>
<li>Hours per week per unit</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="combinations-of-units">Combinations of units</h2>
<ul>
<li>We often combine units to express new quantities</li>
</ul>
<!-- can you think of a derived unit? -->
<h2 id="student-density">Student density</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students per acre</li>
<li>Number per area</li>
<li>Spans two orders of magnitude</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dimensional-analysis-example">Dimensional analysis example</h2>
<p>We can use the dimensions of the relevant quantities to deduce the form of an equation</p>

<h1 id="mass-example">Mass Example</h1>
<p>Convert the quantity of 150 pounds to kilograms.</p>
<p><span class="math display"> 150\ {\color{blue}\cancel{\textrm{pounds}}}
   \cdot
   \frac{1\ \textrm{kilogram}}
        {2.2 \color{blue}\cancel{\textrm{pound}}}
   = 68\ \textrm{kilograms} </span></p>
<h1 id="speed-example">Speed Example</h1>
<p>Convert the quantity of 100 miles per hour to meters per second. Note that we make two unit conversions. One from miles to meters and another from hours to seconds.</p>
<p>Once we have this set up, we perform the computation on a calculator or other device.</p>
<p>Some students prefer to perform this computation in steps.</p>
<p><span class="math display"> \frac{100\ {\color{blue}\cancel{\textrm{miles}}}}
        {\color{green}\cancel{\textrm{hour}}}
   \cdot
   \frac{1600\ \textrm{meters}}
        {\color{blue}\cancel{\textrm{mile}}}
   \cdot
   \frac{\color{green}\cancel{\textrm{hour}}}
        {3600\ \textrm{sec}}
   = \frac{44\ \textrm{meters}}
          {\textrm{sec}} </span></p>
<h1 id="per-per-example">“Per Per” Example</h1>
<p>In August 2021, Sonoma County is recording 20 new cases per day per 100,000 people. If we have a population of 5,000 people, how many cases per week do we expect?</p>
<p><span class="math display"> \frac{20 \textrm{cases}}{{\color{green}\cancel{\textrm{day}}}\cdot 100,000\ \color{blue}\cancel{\textrm{people}}}
\cdot
   5,000\ {\color{blue}\cancel{\textrm{people}}}
\cdot
   \frac{7\ \color{green}\cancel{\textrm{day}}}{\textrm{week}}
= 7\ \textrm{cases per week}
</span></p>
